# calculus
integration & differentiation programs
It is a project which uses c and java to perform definite bounded integrals and differentials
No idea about indefinite tho currently. Will concider later.
GUI will be java interface and writing logic code will be given prority over gui first.
**UPDATE:fuck GUI it will be a cli program
documentation about functions and variables is in code itself
classe's documentation will be given alongside after creating the testing files.
Auto testing will be used subject to manually also checking the basic functionality of functions
and edge cases.
current objective:
***current main target :dynamic execution  *** method:Dijkstra’s Algorithm
completion: today if redbull lasts long enough..
**NOTE: all classes uses buffer/scanner functions currently and will use until logic is written.
gui will only be implemented later.
feel free to comment/point any unoptimised or shit code/algo since I am still a beginner and sophomore.
