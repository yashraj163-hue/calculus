# calculus
integration & differentiation programs
It is a project which uses c and java to perform definite bounded integrals and differentials
No idea about indefinite tho currently.
Will concider later.
GUI will be java interface and writing logic code will be given prority over gui first.
documentation about functions and variables is in code itself
classe's documentation will be given alongside after creating the testing files.
**NOTE all classes uses buffer/scanner functions currently and will use until logic is written.
gui will only be implemented later
